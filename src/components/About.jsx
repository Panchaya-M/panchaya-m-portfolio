          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm a frontend developer with a passion for building
            clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a few years of experience, I've had the chance to work on some
            exciting projects that sharpened my ability to think critically and
            code efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m always up for a challenge and love diving into new frameworks
            and tools.
          </p>
